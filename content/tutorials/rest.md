Both Clipper's management and query interfaces expose a REST API. While we provide the Clipper Admin
client library as a convenient Python wrapper around the management functionality, you can also use the REST
API directly, or create your own client libraries in other languages. You can find the full REST documentation below. If you create a client library in another language (e.g. several users have expressed interest in a Go implementation), consider contributing it back to the project as an official client library.
